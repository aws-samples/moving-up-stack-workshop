### The Ask

> Example Corp find rapid adoption of their modernized management tools and other development teams want to migrate their application to benefit from functionality provided by Proton. Example Corp wants to take this as opportunity to track how many of their workloads have been migrated and identify all AWS resources that belong to each corresponding application.

> To help the customer, we will create a repository of their applications  and associated resources. This will allow the customer to define their application metadata and understand the context of their applications across the environments.


### The Task

> We are going to create new Proton template that integrates with the AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry. We also are going to update the Proton infrastructure and service template to associate existing and new resources with an application. Finally, weâ€™re going to update the services deployed by Proton to the new version and provide metadata.

You can follow these steps to do this:

- Create AppRegistry application
- Update Proton infrastructure and application resources and provide metadata information
- Query AppRegistry application metadata to understand the context of your applications
